# sys-tune
Forked from the original repo [here](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/sys-tune)

This version does exactly the same as the original, with the following features added:
- Playlists are now saved when restarting the switch
- A new option appears in the menu, allowing your playlist to automatically start playing when you turn your switch on
- Adds a whitelist mode, which does the opposite of blacklist, where a song ONLY plays when at a specific title id

2. Extract the zip to the root of your sd card.
3. Put mp3, flac, wav or wave files to your sd card.
